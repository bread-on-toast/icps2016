            <h3>Workshop 1 (B1)</h3>

            <h4>Ambassador programme (16:00-16:45)</h4>
            <h5>by Henrik Siboni, IAPS Executive Committee</h5>

            <p>Are you tired of your university not being active in IAPS? Do something about it as a Student Ambassador! As an ambassador of IAPS, you are part of an international team working to improve the lives of physics students on a global plane by acting locally. Work areas can include putting up poster, telling your colleagues, setting up member committees and more - it's up to you. You will also have easy access to the PR volunteer with which you can discuss your progress. In this workshop you will become generation 0 for all the future IAPS ambassadors.</p>

            <h4>IAPS Contact Network (16:45-17:30)</h4>
            <h5>by Sabrina Gronow, IAPS Executive Committee</h5>

            <p>To help each student interested in an exchange or starting at a new university, IAPS is establishing a Contact Network. The goal is to have at least one student at each university in it, willing to help others with information on the university, city or country. At the same time it's always nice to already know a person in the city you move to, e.g. to find good places to hang out.</p>

            <p>In this workshop we will explore the options of establishing such a network. What universities are within IAPS reach? What universities should be targeted? How and which data should be exchanged? These are the types of questions to be answered.</p>

            <h3>Workshop 2 (B2)</h3>

            <h4>Organise events with IAPS (16:00-17:30)</h4>
            <h5>by Gerhard Dorn, PLANCKS Organising Committee 2017</h5>
            <h5>and Danielle Harper, NC UK</h5>

            <p>How to use IAPS environment to organise events - for physics students by physics students?</p>

            <p>When cooking an event such as iaps2cern, iaps4fusion, Light of Tuscany or something else, you need several key ingredients. The base would be a good team to help build sturdy infrastructure, efficient communication and of course some time-management skills.</p>

            <p>In this workshop we will discuss best IAPS recipes for events and try to devise new ones. Maybe you have already organised a local event or two and want to take things international? This workshop will also discuss scalability of events since in case of switch from national to international event, some new problem areas arise. Nothing a physics student can't handle though.</p>

            <h3>Workshop 3 (ALT)</h3>

            <h4>School Day (16:00-17:30)</h4>
            <h5>by Sabrina Gronow, Ana Milinović, IAPS Executive Committee</h5>

            <p>Last year IAPS, with its members, decided to organise an outreach event for the International Year of Light. Members came together and so the School Day took place. As last year, the event should take place on November 10th (2016), which coincides with UNESCO World Science Day for Peace and Development.</p>

            <p>Following the AGMs’ decision on the topic for 2016, this workshop will focus on logistics and science of the event. On an event of this scale, it is important to coordinate so together we will try figure out the best way to do just that. We will go through a couple of event templates and see which type can be implemented in your university. After you decide how you want to present, it is also important to discuss what you want to present so in the last part of this workshop we will discuss some experiment and showcase ideas.</p>

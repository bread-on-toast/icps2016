title: Annual General Meeting
subTitle: The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of IAPS traditionally takes place during ICPS. The AGM is the main governing body of IAPS which decides on the charter and the regulations of IAPS if changes are necessary. The members of the executive committee are elected during the AGM and the delegates approve the finances of IAPS. Other important points are decisions concerning the acceptance of new members and it decides where the next ICPS will take place. Although voting rights are reserved for the official delegates from the local, national committees and individual members of IAPS, the AGM is open to all members of the association. Hence if you are interested in the work of the association you are most welcome to participate in the AGM.

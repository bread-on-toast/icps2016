title: Scientific student contributions
subTitle: This conference also gives students the opportunity to present and attend student lectures. These lectures help students sharpen their presentation skills and overcome the fear of presenting a topic to an academic audience, as well as encouraging students to question and discuss their topic of interest. Poster sessions are also offered. These allow students to present their work in a poster, give a short talk about the poster itself and then be open for any questions. Participating in either event will make you eligible to win a prize.

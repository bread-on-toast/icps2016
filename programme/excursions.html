    <h4>Cultural part: Għar Dalam</h4>

    <p>Għar Dalam’s relevance as a prehistoric site was discovered in the latter half of the 19th Century with a series of excavations unearthing animal bones as well as human remains and artefacts. The Cave is a highly important site for its Palaeontology, archaeology and ecology. The history of the cave and that of the Islands can be decoded from Għar Dalam’s stratigraphy. The lowermost layers, more than 500,000 years old, contained the fossil bones of dwarf elephants, hippopotami, micro-mammals and birds among other species. This layer is topped by a pebble layer, and on top of it there is the so-called ‘deer’ layer, dated to around 18,000 years ago. The top layer, or ‘cultural layer’, dates less than 10,000 years and holds evidence of the first humans on the Island. It was here that the earliest evidence of human settlement on Malta, some 7,400 years ago, was discovered.</p>

    <p>The site consists of a cave, a Victorian style exhibition and a didactic display as well as a garden planted with indigenous plants and trees.</p>

Fizoptika brings a world of experience having been in the Industry since 1989.</p>

    <h4>Cultural part: Mdina</h4>

    <p>Mdina is a fortified city situated on a hill in the Northern Region of Malta. It served as the island's capital from antiquity until 1530, when the capital was moved to Birgu. Punic remains uncovered beyond the city’s walls suggest the importance of the general region to Malta’s Phoenician settlers. Mdina is commonly called the "Silent City" by natives and visitors. The town is still confined within its walls, and has a population of just under 300.</p>

    <p>A city tour together with visits to the main attractions of Mdina will be organized for the participants.</p>

    <h3>Option 6</h3>

    <h4>Scientific part: <a href="http://heritagemalta.org">Diagnostic Science Laboratories</a></h4>

    <p>The Diagnostic Science Laboratories (DSL) primary aim is to develop and promote appropriate solutions to the conservation problems of objects, art, architecture, archaeological sites and monuments.</p>

    <p>DSL staff members carry out research in a multidisciplinary team effort to ensure the protection of our collections through the application of recent scientific knowledge in accordance with international practices. Scientists provide essential information to conservators about deterioration causes, principal factors influencing the damage mechanisms and compatible treatment options. They also conduct scientific research on the composition of materials, authentication and identification that can contribute to the scholarly interpretation of art and artefacts from the past.</p>

    <p>DSL also operates a section dedicated to environmental monitoring and preventive conservation. This section was set up to address the preservation concerns of a vast amount of cultural heritage materials under the care of Heritage Malta and to reduce the real risks to our cultural treasures.</p>

    <h4>Cultural part: The Three Cities</h4>

    <p>The Three Cities offer an intriguing insight into Malta and its history. Left largely unvisited, these cities are a slice of authentic life as well as a glimpse into Malta's maritime fortunes. The Three Cities can rightly claim to be the cradle of Maltese history, as Vittoriosa (Birgu), Senglea (Isla) and Cospicua (Bormla) have provided a home and fortress to almost every people who settled on the Islands. Their harbour inlets have been in use since Phoenician times: the docks always providing a living for local people, but also leaving them vulnerable when Malta's rulers were at war. As the first home to the Knights of St. John, the Three Cities' palaces, churches, forts and bastions are far older than Valletta's.</p>

    <p>The local communities here celebrate holy days and festas as nowhere else on the Islands. The most spectacular events are the Easter processions when statues of the "Risen Christ" are carried at a run through crowded streets.</p>

The Cave is a highly important site for its Palaeontology, archaeology and ecology. The history of the cave and that of the Islands can be decoded from Għar Dalam’s stratigraphy. The lowermost layers, more than 500,000 years old, contained the fossil bones of dwarf elephants, hippopotami, micro-mammals and birds among other species. This layer is topped by a pebble layer, and on top of it there is the so-called ‘deer’ layer, dated to around 18,000 years ago. The top layer, or ‘cultural layer’, dates less than 10,000 years and holds evidence of the first humans on the Island. It was here that the earliest evidence of human settlement on Malta, some 7,400 years ago, was discovered.</p>

    <p>The site consists of a cave, a Victorian style exhibition and a didactic display as well as a garden planted with indigenous plants and trees.</p>

    <h3>Option 6</h3>

    <h4>Scientific part: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DiagnosticScienceLaboratories/">Diagnostic Science Laboratories</a></h4>
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DiagnosticScienceLaboratories/" class="image featured"><img src="images/dsl.jpg"/></a>

Scientists provide essential information to conservators about deterioration causes, principal factors influencing the damage mechanisms and compatible treatment options. They also conduct scientific research on the composition of materials, authentication and identification that can contribute to the scholarly interpretation of art and artefacts from the past.</p>

    <p>DSL also operates a section dedicated to environmental monitoring and preventive conservation. This section was set up to address the preservation concerns of a vast amount of cultural heritage materials under the care of Heritage Malta and to reduce the real risks to our cultural treasures.</p>

    <h4>Cultural part: The Three Cities</h4>
    <a href="http://www.maltacultureguide.com/index.php?page=article&article_id=5" class="image featured"><img src="images/3cities.jpg"/></a>

    <p>The Three Cities offer an intriguing insight into Malta and its history. Left largely unvisited, these cities are a slice of authentic life as well as a glimpse into Malta's maritime fortunes. The Three Cities can rightly claim to be the cradle of Maltese history, as Vittoriosa (Birgu), Senglea (Isla) and Cospicua (Bormla) have provided a home and fortress to almost every people who settled on the Islands. Their harbour inlets have been in use since Phoenician times: the docks always providing a living for local people, but also leaving them vulnerable when Malta's rulers were at war. As the first home to the Knights of St. John, the Three Cities' palaces, churches, forts and bastions are far older than Valletta's.</p>

    <p>The local communities here celebrate holy days and festas as nowhere else on the Islands. The most spectacular events are the Easter processions when statues of the "Risen Christ" are carried at a run through crowded streets.</p>

    <h4>Oceanography and Kayaking</h4>
    <a href="http://www.ioos.noaa.gov/surface_currents/welcome.html" class="image featured"><img src="images/oceanography.jpg"/></a>

    <p>High frequency (HF) radar systems measure the speed and direction of ocean surface currents in near real time. Currents in the ocean are equivalent to winds in the atmosphere because they move things from one location to another. These currents carry nutrients as well as pollutants, so it is important to know the currents for ecological and economic reasons. A lecture on ocean currents, fluid mechanics and the HF radar, will be given by Dr. Anthony Galea at the University's HF radar location. This will be given by the beach.</p>

    <p>Sea kayaking in Malta and Gozo is one of the best ways to experience the natural beauty of the Maltese Island's shorelines. Experience the beauty of the turquoise sea, witness the cliffs from a unique perspective and visit the island of Kemuna. It will surely be an excision to remember.</p>

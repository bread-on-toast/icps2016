            <h2>From quantum weirdness to quantum technologies</h2>
            <h3><a href="">Dr. André Xeureb</a></h3>

            <p>Quantum mechanics arose out of trying to understand how the world works on the atomic scale. A century later, it has revolutionised our understanding of the laws of the universe; many long-held ideas, such as the possibility to watch an object without disturbing it, have been turned upside down in the process. In this talk I will run through some basic concepts of quantum mechanics and show they are no longer just theoretical curiosities but well-established realities. I will focus on what is being termed the next industrial revolution, where we will start exploiting the power of quantum mechanics to communicate with absolute secrecy, produce computers that can solve problems ordinary computers cannot, develop sensors that are more sensitive than is otherwise possible, and build super-efficient engines.</p>

            <h2>Transient astronomy - bursts, bangs and things that go bump in the night</h2>
            <h3><a href="">Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell</a></h3>

            <p>Often when we view the Universe in a new way, new and unexpected phenomena are discovered.  Recent developments in detectors (for example CCDs) and in computers are now allowing astronomers to search systematically for short duration phenomena – flares, bursts and other kinds of changes in the brightness of stars and galaxies.  Some such phenomena were already known (supernovae, for example), and some have been accidentally discovered (gamma ray bursts, for example). There has also recently been more systematic searching for moving objects, such as asteroids that might impact the earth.</p>

            <p>We are now entering a new phase with more and bigger telescopes, larger data flows, and observations with new, lower frequency, radio telescopes. This talk will describe this burgeoning field and speculate on what might be found.</p>

            <h2>Rosetta: To Catch a Comet!</h2>
            <h3><a href="">Prof. Mark McCaughren</a></h3>

            <p>The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission captured the imagination of the world in 2014, as it rendezvoused with Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and deployed a lander, Philae, to its surface. In this talk, I'll give a behind-the-scenes view of the mission, its history, the 10-year journey to reach the comet, and the exciting events that have been taking place there. I'll talk about some of the challenges and risks involved in the mission, and give some idea of what scientists are finding as they unlock this treasure chest of information about the formation of our solar system, the origins of water and perhaps even life on Earth. And to end, a look forward to the final phase of the mission, now that Rosetta, Philae, and the comet are past their closest approach to the Sun and heading back out into the cold.</p>

            <h3>Workshop 1 (Hall B1)</h3>

            <h4>Gateway 2 Science: A Database for Academia (11:30-13:00)</h4>
            <h5>by David Jacome, St. John’s University</h5>

            <p>Our project involves connecting all levels of students to science. Members gain the opportunity to interact with others without having to leave the comfort of their schools or home country. Through the Portal, a door is automatically opened linking students to projects worldwide and expanding their knowledge on interdisciplinary science subjects each day on newer technologies in different countries. Within the database, we will have three role categories: Student, Instructor, and Professional. The student database will consist of about 1 million profiles from science students all over the world. Every student profile will have a picture, marketplace, research work, resumes, and previous experiences. Students will be able to transfer information from LinkedIn directly onto our platform. Instructors will have a similar database as students, but will be able to search for students in an effort to recruit them to projects, or research. The Professional role will allow schools to connect on our platform to plan events, post jobs, recruit students or instructors to there schools, and much more. We went from calling the idea Science Connection to Physics Connection to Physics Portals, and finally have a name we can all like – Gateway 2 Science: It’s a New Way to Stay Connected!</p>

As you might have seen on our [website](http://icps2016.com) we have been working hard to provide a good variety of [guest speakers](http://icps2016.com/programme/guests.html), [grouped student lectures](http://icps2016.com/programme/students.html), and workshops organised by [IAPS](http://icps2016.com/programme/iaps.html) and the [Organising Committee](http://icps2016.com/programme/workshops.html).

All the abstracts and detailed time schedules can be found online on the [abstract booklet](http://icps2016.com/programme/abstracts.pdf).

The programme booklet is also [online](http://icps2016.com/programme/program.pdf) but will also be distributed inside the conference bags.

We hope that you find our scientific programme interesting and enjoy it during the conference!

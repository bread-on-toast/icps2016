    title: 'The Barcode conspiracy - a Physicist''s point of view'
    abstract: The Barcode conspiracy is quite a big deal in Germany - but what is it really about. Time for a Physicist to really address this matter - in a fun but still scientific way.

    title: Quantum Mechanics and Steam Engines
    abstract: The extensive study of phenomenological thermodynamics began in the early 19th century by the work of Joule, Carnot etc. for the practical reasons of optimizing steam engines. It took quite a bit more time  before its microscopic counterpart, the statistical mechanics of Boltzmann and Gibbs became widely accepted. Although some rather philosophical questions about the arrow of time etc. remain open, this statistical mechanics has been succesfully unified with quantum mechanics by now. Some foundations of this were realized by Von Neumann, but the last decade a renewed interest has arisen in the thermalization of many-body quantum systems because of the experimental access to quantum systems using cold gasses. We will take a look at how work can be extracted from integrable quantum systems, described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble, a concept introduced by E.T. Jaynes in 1957. Thus, we will take a look at the questions posed by Carnot et al. from a modern Quantum Statistical perspective.

    title: Quantum model of space and its implications
    abstract: 'The highest aim in theoretical physics, combining the quantum and relativity theories in a new approach: a qualitative model of a quantum space, in which some physical phenomenons are explained by the properties of a quantum space and its interaction with matter. It is based on the idea of a quantum of space and the way it behaves when being occupied by matter, its interaction with surrounding quantum space locations and implications on the behavior of time. The model offers a intuitive explanation of gravitation, quantum inseparability and some other relativistic effects. '

    title: What would Aristotle say?
    abstract: "Throughout history, it is possible to see scientific progress alongside big societal changes which allowed for them to happen. But can we say when physics started? What is physics? And what would Aristotle say to our modern scientific method?\nThese are some of the questions I will discuss in my slam lecture. They are without a clear answer so what will be covered is a couple of possible answers and their arguments, leaving you to think for yourself."

    title: 'We''ve got them!'
    abstract: On Feb 11th there was a big party at my institute. The reason for that was the first detection of gravitational waves. I like to explain to you how this was actually done and why this is such a big deal. You will also learn what spacetime and jello have in common.

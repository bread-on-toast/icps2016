subTitle: The University of Malta traces its origins to the founding of the Collegium Melitense in 1592. Situated at Tal-Qroqq, it is the highest teaching institution of Malta. There are nearly 11,600 students from Malta as well as foreign countries following a full-time or part-time degree or diploma course at our University. Lectures and presentations will be held in the lecture theatres while social events and parties will be held in the Quadrangle. Surrounded by trees and adjacent to the student house and canteen, the Quad is a spacious area where people can relax in the shade of the trees and rest on several benches making it ideal for social events.

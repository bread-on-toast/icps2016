                                    <p>Obviously, you will have to pay for these nights by yourself.

                                    <header>

                                    <p>According to the charter of IAPS you have to study physics or a physics-related subject to attend the ICPS. PhD students in physics are also very welcome as well as physics students up to one year after receiving their degree. Nevertheless you have to be a member of the IAPS to attend the conference. Therefore you have to join a national or local committee of IAPS in your country/city of study. If no such committee exists you can become a provisional individual member of IAPS during the registration process.</p>

										<h3>How can I get internet access during the conference?</h3>
									</header>
                                    <p>If your home university is part of the 'eduroam' project, there will be Wi-Fi available for free on campus, where most of the scientific program is being held. In this case you can directly login with your eduroam account details. At the moment, we are working on a free Wi-Fi access on campus for all participants.</p>

									</header>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, the age restriction on attending the ICPS 2014 is very strict and we cannot make any exceptions. The age restriction is related to the fact that you are not of full age in Germany if you are younger than 18 years. Nevertheless, we want to encourage you to apply for the ICPS 2017.</p>

							of the conference.</p>
						<header>
							<h3>Can you help me to get a visa for Malta?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Yes, we provide confirmation letters to be presented at the Maltese embassy, if needed. If so, please indicate it during the registration process. We can only send you the confirmation letter after we have received the full payment of the conference
							fee.</p>
						<header>
							<h3>Are only physics students allowed to attend the ICPS?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>According to the charter of IAPS you have to study physics or a physics-related subject to attend the ICPS. PhD students in physics are also very welcome as well as physics students up to one year after receiving their degree. Nevertheless you have
							to be a member of the IAPS to attend the conference. Therefore you have to join a national or local committee of IAPS in your country/city of study. If no such committee exists you can become a provisional individual member of IAPS during the registration
							process.</p>
						<header>
							<h3>When is the deadline for the submission of scientific contributions?</h3>

						<p>The deadline for all contributions is June 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>

						<p>It is not possible to change your selected excursions. Most of the excursions have only limited spaces and are booked out. The prices depend on your choice of excursions. </p>

						<header>
							<h3>Do I have to be a member of IAPS to attend the conference?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Yes, you have to be a member of a national or local committee of IAPS to attend the conference. Therefore you have to join a national or local committee of IAPS in your country/city of study. If no such committee exists, you can become a provisional

						<header>
							<h3>How can I get internet access during the conference?</h3>

						<p>If your home university is part of the 'eduroam' project, there will be Wi-Fi available for free on campus and at the residence. In this case you can directly login with your eduroam account details. At the moment, we are working on a free Wi-Fi
							access on campus for all participants.</p>

							<h3>Can I take part in the ICPS although I am younger than 18 years?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Unfortunately, the age restriction on attending the ICPS 2016 is very strict and we cannot make any exceptions. The age restriction is related to the fact that you are not considered as an adult in Malta if you are younger than 18 years. Nevertheless,
							we want to encourage you to apply for ICPS 2017.</p>

						<header>
							<h3>Can you give me financial support to pay for my flight or the conference fee?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>We already tried to keep the conference fees as low as possible. We are sorry that we cannot lower the fee for you any further. However, you can participate in the article contest held by jIAPS and win a refund of the conference fee.</p>

						<header>
							<h3>How do I participate in the jIAPS article contest?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Write an article about a physics-related topic of your choice and submit it to jIAPS until June 30, 2016. The writer of the best article wins a refund of the conference fee. Please keep in mind that you still have to pay the conference fee beforehand,
							as the price can only be awarded to accepted participants. You can find more information about the contest <a href="http://jiaps.org/jiaps-article-contest/">here</a>.</p>

						<header>
							<h3>What are the terms of cancellation?</h3>
						</header>
